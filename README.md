# Love2D RPG-Style game template
A RPG-Styled game template made with [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)

Used libraries:
* [bump.lua](https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua)
* [hump.camera](https://hump.readthedocs.io/en/latest/camera.html)
* [hump.timer](https://hump.readthedocs.io/en/latest/timer.html)
* [anim8](https://github.com/kikito/anim8)
* [catui](https://github.com/wilhantian/catui)

Declare every asset you need inside `assets/resources.lua`.

I'm using assets from [here](https://opengameart.org/content/castle-tiles-for-rpgs) for the objects (By Hyptosis, Zabin and Daniel Cook).

You can find documentation about almost everything inside the `docs` directory or at https://pggamer2.github.io/Love2D-RPG/.
You can generate the documentation using [LDoc](https://github.com/lunarmodules/LDoc).
