A RPG-Styled game template made with [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)

Used libraries:

Declare every asset you need inside `assets/resources.lua`.

I'm using assets from [here](https://opengameart.org/content/castle-tiles-for-rpgs) for the objects (By Hyptosis, Zabin and Daniel Cook).

You can find documentation about almost everything inside the `doc` directory.
You can generate the documentation using [LDoc](https://github.com/lunarmodules/LDoc).
